    Because dbus >=0.5.5 <0.7.5 depends on ffi ^1.1.2 and nm >=0.5.0 depends on dbus ^0.7.0, nm >=0.5.0 requires ffi ^1.1.2 or dbus ^0.7.5.
And because connectivity_plus_linux >=1.3.0 depends on nm ^0.5.0, connectivity_plus_linux >=1.3.0 requires ffi ^1.1.2 or dbus ^0.7.5.
And because connectivity_plus ^2.2.1 depends on connectivity_plus_linux ^1.3.0 and package_info_plus >=3.0.0 depends on ffi ^2.0.1, if connectivity_plus ^2.2.1 and package_info_plus >=3.0.0 then dbus ^0.7.5.
And because every version of tl_package from path depends on both connectivity_plus ^2.2.1 and package_info_plus ^3.0.1, every version of tl_package from path requires dbus ^0.7.5.
And because dbus >=0.7.4 depends on xml ^6.1.0 and xml >=5.4.0 <6.2.0 depends on petitparser ^5.0.0, every version of tl_package from path requires petitparser ^5.0.0 or xml ^6.2.0.
And because xml >=6.2.0 depends on petitparser ^5.1.0 and toml ^0.11.0 depends on petitparser ^4.1.0, tl_package from path is incompatible with toml ^0.11.0.
And because every version of tl_recognize depends on tl_text_nlp ^2.0.0 which depends on toml 0.11.0, tl_package from path is incompatible with tl_recognize.
So, because jd_staff_home depends on both tl_recognize ^1.0.0 and tl_package from path, version solving failed.




  xml: ^6.0.1  petitparser: ^5.1.0  toml: ^0.13.1
